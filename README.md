## About the Task

Credit card fraud detection is a critical real‑world problem due to highly **imbalanced data** and the need for accurate classification.
In this task, a supervised learning approach is used to classify transactions as **legitimate** or **fraudulent**.

The entire implementation, from data loading to model evaluation, is documented in the Jupyter Notebook.
## Dataset Description

* **Dataset:** Credit Card Transactions Dataset
* **Source:** Commonly used Kaggle credit card fraud dataset
* **Records:** 284,807 transactions
* **Features:** 30 numerical features (V1–V28, Amount, Time)
* **Target Column:**

  * `Class = 0` → Legitimate transaction
  * `Class = 1` → Fraudulent transaction

The dataset is **highly imbalanced**, with very few fraud cases compared to legitimate ones.
## Objective

* Load and explore the credit card transaction dataset
* Handle class imbalance
* Split the data into training and testing sets
* Train a machine learning model
* Evaluate the model performance using accuracy
## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook**
## Workflow

1. Import required libraries
2. Load the credit card dataset
3. Perform basic data exploration (`head`, `tail`, `info`)
4. Separate legitimate and fraudulent transactions
5. Handle class imbalance
6. Split data into training and test sets
7. Train the model
8. Evaluate model accuracy
## Model Used

* **Logistic Regression**

Reasons for choosing Logistic Regression:

* Simple and interpretable
* Works well for binary classification
* Efficient for large datasets
## Results

* The model successfully classifies transactions
* Accuracy is calculated using `accuracy_score`
* Demonstrates the challenges of fraud detection on imbalanced datasets
*(Exact accuracy may vary depending on data sampling)*
 ## How to Run the Notebook
